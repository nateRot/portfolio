# 236781 - Deep Learning on Computational Accelerators
The course was taught by Prof. Alex Bronstein  
It was a very "hands on" course, with the theory being discussed in class and the assignments addressing the technical aspect.  
The structure of the assignments are a skeleton notebook supplied by staff, with the students completing the supporting files to run the code.  
  
By selecting a partx_xxx.ipynb you can see the results and layout of the assignment.  
  

assignment 1: data preprocessing, KNN, linear classification, linear regression  
assignment 2: deep networks, optimization, CNN  
assignment 3: RNN (text sequence), variational auto encoder (VAE), GAN  
assignment 4: Reinforcement Learning, open question report, and a mini project (sentiment analysis using self attention)
