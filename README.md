# Nate's Portfolio  

This repository holds a select collection of personal projects and school assigmnets I've worked on.  
The school courses were taken within the framework of my Bachelor's Degree at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology:   

**236781 Deep Learning on Computational Accelerators** - course dedicated to understanding the theory and algorithms behind Deep Learning. Topics covered:  
assignment 1: data preprocessing, KNN, linear classification, linear regression  
assignment 2: deep networks, optimization, CNN  
assignment 3: RNN (text sequence), variational auto encoder (VAE), GAN  
assignment 4: Reinforcement Learning, open question report, and a mini project (sentiment analysis using self attention)   

**046195 Introduction to Machine Learning** - an entry level course to basic ML techniques   

**044167 Project** - This was a final project over two parts (semesters). The question we wished to answer in simple terms was "can we use ML to increase operating system performance". Part A of the project addressed scheduling done by the OS, part B addressed cache paging (hit/miss). More details inside the folder   

**046195 Electrical Engineering Lab** - a course offering different labs, need to select 4 to complete the course. I chose ML, Deep Learning, Image Processing, and JAVA
